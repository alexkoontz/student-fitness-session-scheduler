# Student Fitness Training Session Scheduler
**Date:**  September 2019 - Ongoing

**Organization:** Penn State University

**Project Members:** Myself, and Dave McLaughlin (resident Web Developer at Penn State York)

## Problem Description
At Penn State York, there was a need for a web application that would allow students to schedule a 30 to 60 minute session with the campus' fitness instructor.  The orginal way of scheduling was with pen and paper.

## Brainstorming
Dave McLaughlin initiated the project, and suggested that we create a web application that would allow students to sign in and schedule a session with the fitness trainer.  This website would connect to a database that has days of the week, as well as what sessions are available on specific days.  Students would be able to select a session they would like to attend from a list of available dates and times.  

## Steps

### Phase 1 of Development (September - October 2019)

### Phase 2 of Development (tba)

## Final Setup

## Conclusion
This project allowed me to familiarize myself with the PHP programming language.  It also showed me how to access and modify a database by using a combination of **HTML**, **jQuery**, and **PHP**.  This project used a common network stack know as **LAMP**, which stands for Linux, Apache, MySql, and (in this case) PHP.  This combination of operating system, web server, database manager, and programming language allows for this web application to function properly.
