# Student Fitness Training Session Scheduler
**Date:**  September 2019 - 

**Organization:** Penn State University

**Project Members:** Myself, and Dave McLaughlin (resident web developer at Penn State York)

## Problem Description
At Penn State York, there was a need for a web application that would allow students to schedule a 30-minute session with the campus' fitness instructor.  The orginal way of scheduling was with pen and paper.

## Brainstorming
Dave McLaughlin initiated the project, and suggested that we create a web application that would allow students to sign in and schedule a session with the fitness trainer.  This website would connect to a database that has session dates and times, and then input a students user ID when they schedule the specific session.

## Steps

### Phase 1 of Development (September - October 2019)

### Phase 2 of Development (tba)

## Final Setup

## Conclusion
This project got me familiar with programming in the PHP language.  It also showed me how to access and modify a database by using a combination of **HTML**, **jQuery**, and **PHP**.  This project used a common network stack know as **LAMP**, which stands for Linux, Apache, MySql, and (in this case) PHP.  This combination of operating system, web server, database manager, and programming language allows for this web application to function properly.
