# Student Fitness Training Session Scheduler
**Date:**  September 2019 - 

**Organization:** Penn State University

**Project Members:** Myself, and Dave McLaughlin (resident web developer at Penn State York)

## Problem Description
At Penn State York, there was a need for a web application that would allow students to schedule a 30-minute session with the campus' fitness instructor.  The orginal way of scheduling was with pen and paper.

## Brainstorming
Dave McLaughlin initiated the project, and suggested that we create a web application that would allow students to sign in and schedule a session with the fitness trainer.  This website would connect to a database that has session dates and times, and then input a students user ID when they schedule the specific session.
